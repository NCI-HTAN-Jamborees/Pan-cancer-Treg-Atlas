Workflow:
1- compare data annotation from 3 different sources:
- CZI cellxgene
- cell typist
- custom T-reg signature (gating strategies)
2- HTAN data transfer
- Google cloud to 7 bridges

Suggested pipeline is to download scRNAseq data and annotate different subpopulations of T-cells using different approaches to further subtype Tregs.
